Servings: 8-12

INGREDIENTS
8-12 boneless skinless chicken thighs
Oil for frying

Buttermilk Marinade
2 cups buttermilk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Seasoned Flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1½ teaspoons black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder

Dill Dip
1½ cups plain Greek yogurt
3 tablespoons chopped dill
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Honey Lemon Dip
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon red chili flakes

PREPARATION
In a medium bowl, combine all the buttermilk marinade ingredients. Toss in chicken thighs and marinate for at least one hour in the refrigerator.
In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for dill dip. Cover and let sit for at least an hour in the refrigerator.
In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for honey lemon dip.
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients for seasoned flour. Dip chicken in flour until chicken is completely covered. Repeat for all chicken thighs.
Heat the oil to 350˚F/180˚C in a deep pot. Do not fill more that ½ full with oil. Carefully fry chicken for roughly 7 minutes, or until cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165˚F/75˚C), and it’s golden brown and crispy. Drain on a paper towel.
Serve with dips.
